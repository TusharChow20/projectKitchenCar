## 🍔 Overview

**Project Kitchen Car** is a dynamic **React-based food ordering app** that simulates a real-time order process.

When you click **“Confirm Order”**, the food goes into the **Cooking** section, and after a few seconds, it automatically moves to the **Served** section — mimicking a kitchen workflow.

This project was built to practice **React state management**, **Context API**, and **real-time UI updates**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Data Fetching with Axios** – Smoothly loads order data from a JSON API.  
🧠 **Global State with useContext** – Shares order data across components.  
⏱️ **Dynamic Timer** – Automatically transitions from *Cooking → Served* after countdown.  
🧩 **Component Communication** – State updates flow from parent to all children seamlessly.  
💅 **Tailwind Styling** – Clean, modern UI with responsive design.

## 🧠 What I Learned

📚 Implementing **Context API** to share and update data across multiple components  
🕒 Handling **timers and side effects** using `useEffect`  
🔄 Managing **dynamic state transitions** for real-time updates  
🎨 Structuring reusable UI with **props and state**  
⚡ Building a clean, deployable React project with **Netlify**

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. Data fetched via Axios → displayed in Food Cards 🍛  
2. User clicks **“Confirm Order”** → item added to Cooking List 🔥  
3. A timer starts ⏳ → countdown visible on the button  
4. Once time ends → item auto-moves to Served List ✅  
5. Counts update in real-time 📊
