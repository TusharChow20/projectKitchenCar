## 🍔 Overview

**Project Kitchen Car** is a dynamic **React-based food ordering app** that simulates a real-time order process.

When you click **“Confirm Order”**, the food goes into the **Cooking** section, and after a few seconds, it automatically moves to the **Served** section — mimicking a real kitchen workflow.

This project was built to practice **React state management**, **Context API**, and **real-time UI updates**.

---

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Data Fetching with Axios** – Smoothly loads order data from a JSON API.  
🧠 **Global State with useContext** – Shares order data across multiple components.  
⏱️ **Dynamic Timer** – Automatically transitions from *Cooking → Served* after countdown.  
🧩 **Component Communication** – State updates flow cleanly across all components.  
💅 **Tailwind Styling** – Clean, modern, responsive UI.

## 🧠 What I Learned

📚 Implementing **Context API** to manage shared states efficiently.  
🕒 Handling **timers and side effects** using `useEffect`.  
🔄 Managing **dynamic state transitions** between multiple arrays.  
🎨 Structuring clean, reusable UI with **React components**.  
⚡ Building and deploying a responsive React project with **Netlify**.  

---

## 🧑‍🍳 How It Works

1. Data fetched via **Axios** → displayed as Food Cards 🍛  
2. User clicks **“Confirm Order”** → item added to **Cooking** 🔥  
3. A **timer** starts → countdown shown dynamically ⏳  
4. When done → item auto-moves to **Served** ✅  
5. Counts for both **Cooking** and **Served** update live 📊
